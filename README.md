Pacletras is a labyrinth puzzle game based on pygame that helps children learn how to spell. Only by picking up the correct letters can the player leave the puzzle and reach the end. The instructions and words are in portuguese, but can be adapted to english easily.

Levels are defined as python files and are straightforward to modify and create anew.
